- 👋 Hi, I’m @klamacc
- 👀 I’m interested in solving real-world problems with blockchain solutions. I have the vision and the ideas, now I just have to work as hard as I can to make it real.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React using fullstackopen.org course and https://www.engineeringwithutsav.com/coding-roadmap in order to have the cleanest learning path possible. First, I focus on the fundamentals, then on more advanced piece of technology. 
- 💞️ I’m working to improve my problem solving skills first by doing a lot of classical computer science exercices, then, when the time comes, I'll try to work on my own project.
- 📫 Keeping track of my record : All my progression day by day will be written here. My Journey beggins.
- 16.08 : git and github setup, node.js installed, vscode configured & extensions installed. Memory refresh of HTML, CSS and programming's basic principles (Data types, functions, variables, Objects, etc...).
